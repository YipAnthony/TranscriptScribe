            You are a medical transcript analyzer. Your task is to extract comprehensive structured information from the following medical transcript.

            Please analyze the transcript and extract the following information:

            **CORE MEDICAL INFORMATION:**
            1. **Medical Conditions**: Only include medical conditions or diagnoses that are explicitly diagnosed or confirmed by the provider or patient. Use SPECIFIC medical terminology rather than general descriptions. For example:
               - Use "hypertension" instead of "high blood pressure"
               - Use "diabetes mellitus" instead of "diabetes"
               - Use "myocardial infarction" instead of "heart attack"
               - Use "cerebrovascular accident" instead of "stroke"
               - Use "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease" instead of "COPD"
               Do NOT include suspected, possible, or likely diagnoses.
            2. **Medications**: Only include specific medications that are actually prescribed, administered, or recommended. Use generic names when possible. Do NOT include dosages, frequencies, or instructionsâ€”just the medication name.
            3. **Procedures**: Only include specific medical procedures, surgeries, or treatments that are actually performed or recommended. Use standard medical terminology.

            **DEMOGRAPHICS:**
            4. **Age**: Extract patient age if mentioned
            5. **Sex**: Extract patient sex (MALE or FEMALE) if mentioned

            **LOCATION:**
            6. **Location**: Extract any location details (city, state, country, zip code) if mentioned

            **COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL RECORD:**
            7. **Symptoms**: 
            - Positive symptoms: symptoms the patient is experiencing
            - Negative symptoms: symptoms the patient denies or reports as absent
            8. **Lab Results**:
            - Positive lab results: abnormal or significant lab findings
            - Negative lab results: normal lab results or negative findings
            9. **Imaging Results**:
            - Positive imaging results: abnormal or significant imaging findings
            - Negative imaging results: normal imaging results or negative findings
            10. **Medical History**:
                - Past diagnoses: previous medical conditions (use specific terminology)
                - Past surgeries: previous surgical procedures
            11. **Family History**: relevant family medical history
            12. **Lifestyle Factors**:
                - Positive lifestyle factors: healthy behaviors, good habits
                - Negative lifestyle factors: risk factors, unhealthy behaviors

            **IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
            - Always prefer specific medical terminology over general descriptions
            - Use standard ICD-10 or medical dictionary terms when possible
            - For conditions, focus on definitive diagnoses rather than symptoms
            - Be precise and avoid colloquial medical terms

            IMPORTANT: Respond with valid JSON only in the following format:

You are a medical AI assistant tasked with generating a realistic fake patient-doctor conversation transcript.

Based on the following patient information, create a natural, realistic conversation between a patient and their doctor during a medical appointment. Focus on talking about a single particular medical condition that is most important to the patient.

PATIENT INFORMATION:
{patient_info}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create a realistic conversation that flows naturally
2. Include the patient's demographic information naturally in the conversation
3. Include common medical topics such as:
   - Current symptoms or concerns
   - Medications (current and any changes)
   - Lifestyle factors (diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol)
   - Family medical history
   - Previous diagnoses or conditions
   - Lab results or test findings
   - Treatment recommendations
4. **IMPORTANT: Include definitive diagnoses from the provider** - The doctor should make specific diagnoses using proper medical terminology.
5. **Use specific medical terminology** throughout the conversation, especially from the provider
6. Format the transcript as plain text (no markdown, no bold, no special formatting). Use clear speaker identification, e.g.:

Dr. Smith: Good morning, [Patient Name]. How have you been feeling since our last visit?

[Patient Name]: Good morning, Doctor. I've been doing okay, but I wanted to talk about...

Dr. Smith: I understand. Let's discuss that...

7. Make it approximately 15-25 exchanges between patient and doctor
8. Include realistic medical terminology but keep it accessible
9. Show appropriate doctor-patient rapport and professionalism
10. DO NOT include any introductory or summary text. ONLY output the conversation itself. Do NOT say things like "Here's a realistic patient-doctor conversation transcript based on the provided patient information." Just give the conversation.

Generate a realistic, engaging conversation that would be typical for a medical appointment with this patient.
